         <h5>ZeeZee - Because jewels dress you up </h5>
         <p> 
            The ZeeZee was born from a dream.<br> I wanted to create jewels that are Wild and Delicate at the same time, that have personalities and are not bound by the boundaries set by a certain style. They themselves are style. <br>
            My name is Bekő Fóri Zenkő, I am an actress and jeweler. <br> Creating keeps me fresh, it motivates me, creating makes me create. I incorporate myself into every piece of creation, whether it a role or a jewel. <br> I incorporate the world a little into every piece. I from it to be wearable. Every jewel and role then forms me.<br>
            That’s why jewelry is not simply a hobby. For me it’s an artform.
